# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-06-24

## Context
Nexa Manager requires a modern, scalable web application stack for a business management platform. The application needs to handle:
- Real-time data updates
- Complex business logic
- Multi-language support
- Mobile responsiveness
- High performance requirements
- Modern development workflow

## Decision
We chose the following technology stack:
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Deployment**: AWS Amplify
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js vs React
- Vue.js: Easier learning curve, good documentation
- React: Larger ecosystem, better TypeScript support, team familiarity
- **Decision**: React for ecosystem and team expertise

### Webpack vs Vite
- Webpack: Mature, extensive configuration options
- Vite: Faster development builds, simpler configuration
- **Decision**: Vite for development speed and simplicity

### Firebase vs Supabase
- Firebase: Google ecosystem, mature platform
- Supabase: Open source, PostgreSQL, better pricing
- **Decision**: Supabase for SQL compatibility and cost efficiency

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development with hot reload (Vite)
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Modern React features (hooks, concurrent features)
- Utility-first CSS with Tailwind
- Real-time capabilities out of the box
- Strong authentication and authorization
- PostgreSQL for complex queries and relationships

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS can lead to verbose HTML
- Dependency on Supabase as a service
- React ecosystem can be overwhelming for new developers

### Neutral
- Need to maintain knowledge of multiple technologies
- Regular updates required for dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- Use TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow React best practices for performance
- Use Tailwind CSS component patterns for reusability
- Implement proper database migrations with Supabase
