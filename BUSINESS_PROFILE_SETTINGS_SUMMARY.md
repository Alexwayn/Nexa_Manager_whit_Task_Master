# Business Profile Settings Integration - Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

After successfully creating the business profile during onboarding, there was no way to view or edit it in the Settings page. The Company tab was using a different table (`profiles`) instead of the new `business_profiles` table.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Added Business Service Integration**
- ✅ Imported `businessService` into Settings.jsx
- ✅ Added business profile state management
- ✅ Created `fetchBusinessProfile()` function to load existing data
- ✅ Created `handleBusinessProfileSave()` function for saving changes

### 2. **Enhanced Settings State**
- ✅ Added `businessProfile` state to track current business data
- ✅ Added `loadingBusinessProfile` state for loading indicators
- ✅ Extended `profileData` state with business-specific fields:
  - `businessType` (Individual, SME, Corporation, etc.)
  - `industry` (Technology, Healthcare, etc.)
  - `employeeCount` (1, 2-10, 11-50, etc.)
  - `companyDescription` (business description)

### 3. **Redesigned Company Tab**
- ✅ **Smart Status Indicator**: Shows if business profile exists or needs to be created
- ✅ **Complete Business Form**: All fields from the onboarding process
- ✅ **Proper Field Types**: Dropdowns for business type and employee count
- ✅ **Validation**: Required fields marked with asterisks
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner during save operations

### 4. **New Form Fields Added**
- Company Name (required)
- Business Type (dropdown - required)
- Industry (text input)
- Tax ID / VAT Number
- Employee Count (dropdown)
- Business Phone
- Website (with https:// prefix)
- Business Address
- Company Description (textarea)

### 5. **Smart Save Logic**
- ✅ **Create or Update**: Automatically creates new profile or updates existing one
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Shows specific error messages
- ✅ **Success Feedback**: Confirms when profile is saved
- ✅ **Data Refresh**: Reloads business profile data after save

## 🎛️ **How It Works Now**

1. **Navigate to Settings** → **Company tab**
2. **Status Check**: 
   - Green banner if business profile exists
   - Yellow banner if no profile found
3. **Edit Fields**: Modify any business information
4. **Save Changes**: Click "Save Business Profile" button
5. **Confirmation**: Success message appears and data refreshes
