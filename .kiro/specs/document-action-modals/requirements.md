# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the missing modal functionality for the "Request Document" and "Archive" action buttons in the Documents page. Currently, these buttons exist in the UI but are not functional. This feature will create the necessary modal components and integrate them with the existing document management system to provide users with the ability to request documents from others and archive existing documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request documents from other users or external parties, so that I can collect necessary documents for my business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Request Document" button THEN the system SHALL display a request document modal
2. WHEN the request document modal opens THEN the system SHALL provide fields for recipient email, document type, description, and due date
3. WHEN I fill out the request form and submit THEN the system SHALL send a notification/email to the recipient
4. WHEN I submit a document request THEN the system SHALL create a tracking record for the request
5. IF the form has validation errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6. WHEN I cancel the request THEN the system SHALL close the modal without saving

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to archive documents that are no longer actively needed, so that I can organize my document workspace while preserving important files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Archive" button THEN the system SHALL display an archive documents modal
2. WHEN the archive modal opens THEN the system SHALL allow me to select multiple documents to archive
3. WHEN I select documents to archive THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with the list of selected documents
4. WHEN I confirm the archive action THEN the system SHALL move the selected documents to an archived state
5. WHEN documents are archived THEN the system SHALL update the document status and remove them from the main view
6. WHEN I cancel the archive action THEN the system SHALL close the modal without making changes
7. IF no documents are selected THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating selection is required

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new modals to be consistent with the existing UI design and translation system, so that the user experience remains cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modals are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same design patterns as existing modals
2. WHEN the modals are displayed THEN the system SHALL support both English and Italian translations
3. WHEN the modals are displayed THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work on different screen sizes
4. WHEN the modals are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow accessibility best practices
5. WHEN the modals are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the existing color scheme and typography
