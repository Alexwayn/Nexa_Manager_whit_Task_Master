# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nexa Manager project has grown organically and now requires a comprehensive reorganization to improve maintainability, developer experience, and project scalability. The current structure has multiple configuration directories scattered at the root level, inconsistent file placement patterns, mixed documentation locations, and legacy files that need proper organization. This reorganization will establish clear conventions, consolidate related files, and create a more intuitive project structure that supports the team's development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Nexa Manager project, I want a clean and logical root-level directory structure, so that I can quickly locate configuration files, documentation, and project assets without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the project root THEN I SHALL see a consolidated `.config/` directory containing all configuration files
2. WHEN I look for documentation THEN I SHALL find all docs centralized in a single `docs/` directory with clear categorization
3. WHEN I need development tools THEN I SHALL find them organized in a dedicated `tools/` directory
4. WHEN I search for shared assets THEN I SHALL locate them in a centralized `assets/` directory
5. IF there are legacy or backup files THEN they SHALL be properly archived or removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the web application, I want a feature-based code organization, so that I can work on specific business domains without navigating through scattered files across multiple directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work on a specific feature THEN I SHALL find all related components, services, hooks, and types co-located in a feature directory
2. WHEN I need shared functionality THEN I SHALL find reusable components, hooks, and utilities in a dedicated `shared/` directory
3. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN I SHALL see consistent file naming conventions across all directories
4. WHEN I add new functionality THEN I SHALL have clear guidelines on where to place different types of files
5. IF I need to refactor a feature THEN I SHALL be able to work within a single feature directory without affecting other areas

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with services and business logic, I want a unified service layer organization, so that I can maintain consistent patterns for data access, business rules, and external integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for business logic THEN I SHALL find all services organized by domain in feature-specific directories
2. WHEN I need shared services THEN I SHALL locate them in the `shared/services/` directory
3. WHEN I examine service files THEN I SHALL see consistent naming patterns and file extensions
4. WHEN I work with database operations THEN I SHALL find migration files properly organized in the `tools/migrations/` directory
5. IF I need to add new services THEN I SHALL follow established patterns for service organization and naming

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on the project, I want consistent file naming and organization conventions, so that I can predict where files are located and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine TypeScript files THEN I SHALL see consistent `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions used appropriately
2. WHEN I look at component files THEN I SHALL see PascalCase naming for React components
3. WHEN I examine service files THEN I SHALL see camelCase naming with descriptive suffixes
4. WHEN I review utility functions THEN I SHALL find them organized by purpose with clear naming
5. IF I create new files THEN I SHALL have documented conventions to follow for naming and placement

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with tests, I want a clear testing structure that mirrors the application organization, so that I can easily locate and maintain test files alongside their corresponding source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for tests THEN I SHALL find them organized to mirror the source code structure
2. WHEN I examine feature directories THEN I SHALL see test files co-located with their corresponding source files
3. WHEN I need integration tests THEN I SHALL find them in a dedicated testing directory with clear categorization
4. WHEN I work on a feature THEN I SHALL be able to run tests specific to that feature
5. IF I add new functionality THEN I SHALL have clear patterns for where to place corresponding tests

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the project, I want proper handling of configuration files and environment-specific settings, so that I can manage different deployment environments and development setups effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need configuration files THEN I SHALL find them consolidated in the `.config/` directory
2. WHEN I work with environment variables THEN I SHALL see clear examples and documentation for setup
3. WHEN I examine tool configurations THEN I SHALL find them organized by tool type with consistent naming
4. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN I SHALL have clear separation of environment-specific configurations
5. IF I add new tools THEN I SHALL place their configuration files in the appropriate `.config/` subdirectory

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working on documentation, I want a centralized and well-organized documentation structure, so that I can maintain and access project documentation efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for documentation THEN I SHALL find all docs in the centralized `docs/` directory
2. WHEN I need API documentation THEN I SHALL locate it in `docs/api/` with clear organization
3. WHEN I examine development guides THEN I SHALL find them in `docs/development/` with step-by-step instructions
4. WHEN I need architecture information THEN I SHALL access it through `docs/architecture/` with diagrams and explanations
5. IF I create new documentation THEN I SHALL follow established patterns for organization and formatting
