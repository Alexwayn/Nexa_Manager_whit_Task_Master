# Test Fixing Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project currently has 80 failing test suites out of 82 total, with 269 failed tests out of 337 total. The test failures are primarily due to configuration issues, missing files, path resolution problems, and environment setup issues. This feature will systematically fix all failing tests to restore the test suite to a working state.

## Progress Status

### âœ… **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**
- **OCR Provider Factory Issue**: Successfully resolved the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'OpenAI')` error
- **Circular Dependency**: Fixed circular dependency in FallbackOCRProvider
- **Mock Export**: Corrected OCRProvider enum export in scanner mock
- **Test Results**: OCR provider factory tests now pass (8/8 tests passing)
- **Estimated Impact**: ~5-8 test failures resolved

### ðŸ”„ **CURRENT FOCUS**
- **Phase 3.2**: Audit and create missing utility files
- **Phase 3.3**: Resolve missing module dependencies
- **Target**: Complete missing file resolution phase

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Module Resolution Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest to properly resolve path aliases and module imports, so that tests can find the required dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest runs tests THEN all `@/` path aliases SHALL resolve correctly to `src/` directory
2. WHEN Jest runs tests THEN all `@lib/` path aliases SHALL resolve correctly to `src/lib/` directory  
3. WHEN Jest runs tests THEN all `@components/` path aliases SHALL resolve correctly to `src/components/` directory
4. WHEN Jest runs tests THEN all `@utils/` path aliases SHALL resolve correctly to `src/utils/` directory
5. WHEN Jest runs tests THEN all `@services/` path aliases SHALL resolve correctly to `src/services/` directory

### Requirement 2: Fix Missing File Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to have their required dependencies available, so that tests can import and execute successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import service files THEN all referenced service files SHALL exist or be properly mocked
2. WHEN tests import component files THEN all referenced component files SHALL exist or be properly mocked
3. WHEN tests import utility files THEN all referenced utility files SHALL exist or be properly mocked
4. WHEN tests reference missing modules THEN appropriate mock implementations SHALL be provided

### Requirement 3: Fix Environment Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run with proper environment configuration, so that environment-dependent code works correctly in test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN Supabase environment variables SHALL be properly mocked or configured
2. WHEN tests encounter `import.meta.env` THEN Jest SHALL properly handle ES module syntax
3. WHEN tests require environment variables THEN test environment SHALL provide appropriate values
4. WHEN tests run THEN WebSocket URLs and other environment-specific configs SHALL be mocked

### Requirement 4: Fix ES Module Compatibility Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest to properly handle modern ES module syntax, so that tests can run without syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest encounters `import.meta` syntax THEN it SHALL be properly transformed or mocked
2. WHEN Jest processes ES modules THEN module imports SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN Jest runs TypeScript tests THEN TypeScript syntax SHALL be properly handled
4. WHEN Jest processes modern JavaScript THEN all syntax SHALL be compatible

### Requirement 5: Fix Test Setup and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test setup and configuration, so that all tests have the necessary context and mocks to run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN global mocks SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN tests require React context THEN appropriate providers SHALL be available
3. WHEN tests need authentication context THEN Clerk auth SHALL be properly mocked
4. WHEN tests require database access THEN Supabase client SHALL be properly mocked
5. WHEN tests run THEN all necessary polyfills and setup SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Restore Test Suite Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing tests to pass or be properly skipped, so that the test suite provides reliable feedback on code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN at least 95% of tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN tests fail THEN failures SHALL be due to actual code issues, not configuration problems
3. WHEN tests are skipped THEN they SHALL be clearly marked with reasons
4. WHEN test suite completes THEN it SHALL provide accurate coverage information
5. WHEN tests run THEN execution time SHALL be reasonable (under 30 seconds for full suite)
