    "prepared_by": "Generated by TestSprite"
  },
  "product_overview": "This project focuses on systematically fixing and stabilizing the entire test suite of a large React and TypeScript application. The suite was failing due to complex issues involving module resolution, missing dependencies, environment configuration, and ES module compatibility. The solution provides updated Jest configurations, global mocks, and proper environment setups to ensure reliable and maintainable test execution.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Achieve a test pass rate of at least 95% from an initial 18% pass rate.",
    "Resolve all module resolution and path aliasing issues to eliminate import errors in tests.",
    "Implement comprehensive mocking for missing services, components, and utilities to support failing tests.",
    "Configure environment variables and ES module transformations to support modern JavaScript and TypeScript testing.",
    "Improve test performance, reliability, and execution time to enable fast feedback loops for developers.",
    "Provide clear test setup, utilities, and documentation to maintain test suite stability and ease of maintenance."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Updated Jest configuration with proper module name mapping for path aliases and ES module support.",
    "Comprehensive mock infrastructure including authentication, database, service layer, and React context mocks.",
    "Environment setup with mocked Supabase variables, WebSocket URLs, and import.meta.env polyfills.",
    "Fixes for Testing Library mocks and jest-dom matchers to stabilize UI-related tests.",
    "Systematic audit and creation of missing components and utility files to prevent test failures due to missing files.",
    "Incremental phased implementation plan ensuring step-by-step resolution of all failing test issues.",
    "Performance optimization and timeout fixes for critical test suites such as image processing and rate limiting services.",
    "Detailed error handling strategies for module resolution, import syntax, and missing dependencies."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Developer runs the Jest test suite to validate code changes.",
    "Jest uses updated configuration to resolve module imports and path aliases correctly.",
    "Global test setup initializes environment variables, mocks, and polyfills needed for the test environment.",
    "Individual tests import required modules or their mocks and execute test cases.",
    "Test results are collected with improved reliability and provide coverage and failure information.",
    "Developers fix actual code issues based on accurate test feedback rather than configuration errors.",
    "Test improvements and fixes are iteratively integrated following a phased approach until a 95% pass rate is achieved."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "95% or more tests pass successfully across the entire test suite.",
    "No module resolution or missing file import errors appear in test logs.",
    "Test execution time for the full suite stays under 30 seconds for efficient feedback.",
    "All mocked services and utilities conform to the actual interfaces to ensure test reliability.",
    "Tests involving environment variables correctly leverage mocked configuration with no runtime errors.",
    "UI-related test cases pass with stable Testing Library mocks and jest-dom matcher implementations.",
    "Detailed test reports indicate any skipped tests are clearly marked with reasons and are not due to configuration problems."
