## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Integration**: The voice assistant is automatically integrated into the main application through `VoiceAssistantProvider` in `App.jsx`.

2. **Permissions**: Users need to grant microphone permissions for voice recognition to work.

3. **Activation**: Users can activate the voice assistant through:
   - Floating microphone button
   - Manual activation buttons
   - Wake word detection (when implemented)

### Voice Commands

#### Navigation Commands
```
"Go to dashboard"
"Open clients" / "Show clients"
"Navigate to invoices"
"Go to calendar"
"Show reports"
"Open settings"
```

#### Action Commands
```
"Create new invoice"
"Add new client"
"Search for [term]"
"Export data"
"Generate report"
```

#### Help Commands
```
"What can you do?"
"Help me with invoices"
"Show voice commands"
"How do I create a report?"
```

#### System Commands
```
"Turn on dark mode"
"Change language"
"Open voice settings"
"Log out"
```

### Settings Configuration

Access voice settings through:
- Settings page → Voice Assistant section
- Voice settings modal from demo page
- Direct navigation to voice configuration

Available settings:
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle voice assistant functionality
- **Wake Word**: Choose activation phrase
- **Speech Rate**: Adjust TTS speed (0.5x - 2x)
- **Volume**: Control TTS volume
- **Voice**: Select TTS voice
- **Auto-listen**: Continuous listening mode
- **Confirmations**: Require confirmation for destructive actions

## Testing

### Demo Page
Access the comprehensive demo at `/voice-assistant-demo` which includes:
- Status monitoring
- Component testing
- Sample commands
- Settings interface
- Onboarding flow

### Manual Testing
1. **Microphone Permission**: Test permission request flow
2. **Voice Recognition**: Test command recognition accuracy
3. **Command Execution**: Verify navigation and actions work
4. **Error Handling**: Test with denied permissions, unsupported browsers
5. **Settings**: Test all configuration options
6. **Onboarding**: Complete the setup flow

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome**: Full support (recommended)
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Limited support (no webkit speech recognition)
- **Safari**: Partial support

### Required APIs
- `webkitSpeechRecognition` or `SpeechRecognition`
- `speechSynthesis`
- `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
- `navigator.permissions`

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Voice components are lazy-loaded
- **Conditional Rendering**: Components only render when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of speech APIs
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from API failures

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Minimal impact when not actively listening
- **Memory**: ~2-5MB for speech APIs
- **Network**: No external API calls (local processing)
- **Battery**: Moderate impact during active listening

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: All voice data processed locally
- **No Storage**: Voice data is not stored or transmitted
- **Permissions**: Explicit user consent required
- **Privacy**: No voice data leaves the device

### Security Features
- **Permission Validation**: Continuous permission checking
- **Error Boundaries**: Isolated error handling
- **Fallback Options**: Manual alternatives for all voice features
