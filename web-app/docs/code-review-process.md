# Code Review Process

This document outlines the systematic code review process for the Nexa Manager project to ensure code quality, knowledge sharing, and consistent development practices.

## Overview

Code reviews are mandatory for all changes to the main branch. They serve multiple purposes:
- **Quality Assurance**: Catch bugs and improve code quality
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread knowledge across the team

## Review Comments Guidelines

### Providing Feedback

#### Comment Types
- **Must Fix**: Critical issues that block merge
- **Should Fix**: Important improvements that should be addressed
- **Consider**: Suggestions for improvement
- **Nitpick**: Minor style or preference issues
- **Question**: Seeking clarification or understanding

#### Effective Comments
- Be specific and actionable
- Provide examples when helpful
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Offer alternative solutions
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person

#### Example Comments

**Good:**
```
Must Fix: This function doesn't handle the case where `user` is null. 
Consider adding a null check or using optional chaining:
`user?.profile?.name`
```

**Not Helpful:**
```
This is wrong.
```

### Addressing Feedback

#### Author Responsibilities
- Respond to all comments
- Implement requested changes or provide reasoning
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Update tests if functionality changes
- Re-request review after significant changes

#### Response Examples

**Implementing Change:**
```
‚úÖ Fixed: Added null check and updated tests
```

**Providing Reasoning:**
```
ü§î I kept the current approach because it matches the pattern 
used in ComponentX and maintains consistency. The performance 
difference is negligible in this context.
```

**Requesting Clarification:**
```
‚ùì Could you clarify what specific security concern you see here? 
I'm using the same validation pattern as in other forms.
```
