-- =====================================================
-- TEMPORARY FIX: DISABLE RLS FOR CLERK COMPATIBILITY
-- =====================================================
-- This script temporarily disables RLS on integration tables
-- since we're using Clerk instead of Supabase auth

-- Disable RLS on all integration tables
ALTER TABLE api_keys DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE third_party_integrations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE integration_activity DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE webhook_configurations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies (they won't work with Clerk)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own API keys" ON api_keys;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own API keys" ON api_keys;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own API keys" ON api_keys;

-- Create new tables with correct user_id reference to users table instead of auth.users
-- First, we need to modify the foreign key constraints

-- Drop and recreate foreign key constraints to reference the users table instead of auth.users
