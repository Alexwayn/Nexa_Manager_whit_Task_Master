# Reports Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation strategy to make the Reports page fully functional, integrating with existing services and providing comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- ✅ **ReportingService** (`/lib/reportingService.js`) - PDF/Excel/CSV generation
- ✅ **ReportingService** (`/services/reportingService.ts`) - Database views and analytics
- ✅ **Report Types** (`/types/reports.ts`) - Comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ **Invoice Analytics Service** - Revenue and client analytics
- ✅ **Localization** - Multi-language support for reports
- ✅ **UI Components** - Basic report cards and layout

### Current Issues
- ❌ Hardcoded mock data in Reports.jsx
- ❌ No real data integration
- ❌ Non-functional report generation
- ❌ Missing report scheduling
- ❌ No report history/management
- ❌ Charts display empty data

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Data Integration (Priority: High) ✅

#### 1.1 Replace Mock Data with Real Services ✅
- **File**: `Reports.jsx`
- **Actions**:
  - ✅ Replace hardcoded `metrics` with real data from `ReportingService`
  - ✅ Integrate `recentReports` with actual report history
  - ✅ Connect `chartData` to real analytics data
  - ✅ Remove all hardcoded values

#### 1.2 Create Report Management Hook ✅
- **File**: `hooks/useReports.js` (new)
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Fetch report metrics
  - ✅ Manage report generation state
  - ✅ Handle report history
  - ✅ Error handling and loading states

#### 1.3 Implement Real Chart Data ✅
- **Integration Points**:
  - ✅ Revenue vs Expenses: `getRevenueSummary()` + `getExpenseSummary()`
  - ✅ Client Acquisition: `getClientAnalytics()`
  - ✅ Financial metrics: `getProfitLoss()`

### Phase 2: Report Generation System (Priority: High) ✅

#### 2.1 Functional Report Generation ✅
- **File**: `Reports.jsx` - `handleGenerateReport()`
- **Implementation**:
  - ✅ Route to appropriate service method based on report type
  - ✅ Show generation progress
  - ✅ Handle success/error states
  - ✅ Download/preview generated reports

#### 2.2 Report Builder Enhancement ✅
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Dynamic form based on report type
  - ✅ Date range selection
  - ✅ Filter configuration
  - ✅ Format selection (PDF, Excel, CSV)
  - ✅ Real-time preview

#### 2.3 Export Functionality ✅
- **Integration**:
  - ✅ Connect to existing `ReportingService.generateRevenueReport()`
  - ✅ Implement `generateClientReport()`, `generateTaxReport()`
  - ✅ Add download handling
  - ✅ Progress indicators

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: Medium)

#### 3.1 Report Scheduling
- **File**: `components/ReportScheduler.jsx` (new)
- **Features**:
  - Schedule recurring reports
  - Email delivery
  - Frequency configuration
  - Notification system

#### 3.2 Report History & Management
- **File**: `components/ReportHistory.jsx` (new)
- **Features**:
  - View past reports
  - Re-download reports
  - Delete old reports
  - Search and filter history

#### 3.3 Custom Report Builder
- **Enhancement**: Expand existing custom report tab
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop field selection
  - Custom calculations
  - Template saving
  - Advanced filtering

### Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements (Priority: Medium)

#### 4.1 Interactive Charts
- **Library**: Enhance Chart.js integration
- **Features**:
  - Clickable chart elements
  - Drill-down capabilities
  - Export chart as image
  - Responsive design

#### 4.2 Report Preview
- **Component**: `ReportPreview.jsx` (new)
- **Features**:
  - Live preview before generation
  - Print preview
  - Format comparison
  - Quick edit options

#### 4.3 Dashboard Integration
- **Integration**: Connect with Analytics page
- **Features**:
  - Quick report generation from analytics
  - Shared filters and date ranges
  - Cross-navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Reports.jsx
    ↓
useReports Hook
    ↓
ReportingService (TS) ← Database Views
    ↓
ReportingService (JS) ← PDF/Excel Generation
    ↓
File Download/Preview
```

### Key Components to Create/Modify

1. **useReports.js** - Main data management hook
2. **ReportGenerator.jsx** - Report generation component
3. **ReportPreview.jsx** - Preview functionality
4. **ReportScheduler.jsx** - Scheduling interface
5. **ReportHistory.jsx** - History management
6. **Reports.jsx** - Main page (major refactor)

### Database Integration Points

1. **Revenue Reports**: `v_revenue_summary`, `v_profit_loss`
2. **Client Reports**: `v_client_analytics`, `v_client_summary`
3. **Tax Reports**: `v_iva_summary`, `v_tax_summary`
4. **Performance**: `v_performance_metrics`
5. **Report History**: New table `user_reports`

### API Endpoints Needed

1. `GET /api/reports/metrics` - Dashboard metrics
2. `POST /api/reports/generate` - Generate report
3. `GET /api/reports/history` - Report history
4. `POST /api/reports/schedule` - Schedule report
5. `DELETE /api/reports/:id` - Delete report
