# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Document Scanner feature will enable Nexa Manager users to scan physical documents directly into the system using their device's camera or by uploading images. This feature will streamline document management by allowing users to digitize paper documents, extract text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and organize scanned documents within the platform's document management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to scan physical documents using my device's camera, so that I can digitize and store important paperwork in Nexa Manager.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Scanner page THEN the system SHALL display options for camera scanning and file upload.
2. WHEN the user selects the camera option THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions and activate the device camera.
3. WHEN the user captures an image THEN the system SHALL display a preview with options to retake or confirm.
4. WHEN the user confirms the scanned image THEN the system SHALL process and save the document to the user's document library.
5. WHEN the camera is activated THEN the system SHALL provide visual guides to help position the document correctly.
6. IF the device has no camera or camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to file upload option.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to upload existing document images from my device, so that I can import documents without using the camera.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the upload option THEN the system SHALL open a file picker dialog.
2. WHEN the user selects image files (JPG, PNG, PDF) THEN the system SHALL validate and accept the files.
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a preview of each document.
4. IF a file exceeds the maximum size limit THEN the system SHALL display an error message.
5. IF an unsupported file type is selected THEN the system SHALL notify the user of supported formats.
6. WHEN multiple files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them in batch.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the system to automatically enhance scanned documents, so that they are clear and legible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is scanned or uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically apply image enhancement.
2. WHEN enhancing an image THEN the system SHALL adjust contrast, brightness, and remove shadows.
3. WHEN a document is enhanced THEN the system SHALL display before/after comparison.
4. IF the enhanced image quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide manual adjustment controls.
5. WHEN enhancement is complete THEN the system SHALL save both original and enhanced versions.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to extract text from scanned documents using OCR, so that I can search and edit the document content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL perform OCR to extract text content.
2. WHEN OCR is complete THEN the system SHALL display the extracted text alongside the document image.
3. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL allow the user to edit and correct any OCR errors.
4. IF the document contains tables THEN the system SHALL attempt to preserve the table structure.
5. WHEN OCR is performed THEN the system SHALL indicate the confidence level of the text extraction.
6. IF multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL identify and process text in the appropriate language.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to organize and categorize scanned documents, so that I can easily find them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is scanned THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to add metadata (title, category, tags).
2. WHEN saving a document THEN the system SHALL allow association with clients, projects, or financial records.
3. WHEN a document is saved THEN the system SHALL index its content for future search.
4. WHEN viewing the document library THEN the system SHALL display scanned documents with their metadata.
5. WHEN a document is saved THEN the system SHALL generate a unique identifier for reference.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to share scanned documents with clients or team members, so that I can collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a scanned document THEN the system SHALL provide sharing options.

4. IF a shared document is updated THEN the system SHALL notify all users with access.
5. WHEN sharing a document THEN the system SHALL track access and activity history.
