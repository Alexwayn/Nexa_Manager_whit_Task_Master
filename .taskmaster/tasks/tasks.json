Complete InvoiceService development with remaining features:\n   - Payment tracking functionality\n   - Analytics and reporting methods\n   - Notification system for status changes\n2. Develop comprehensive test suite for all service methods\n3. Integrate service with existing UI components\n4.

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Risk - HIGH SEVERITY\n\n#### Dangerous HTML Injection Found\n```jsx\n// QuoteEmailSender.jsx:406 - CRITICAL VULNERABILITY\n<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ \n  __html: emailData.customMessage || getEmailPreview()?.htmlBody \n}} />\n```\n\n**Risk**: User-controlled content (`emailData.customMessage`) is directly injected as HTML without sanitization.\n**Impact**: Malicious scripts could be executed, leading to account takeover, data theft, or malicious actions.\n**Mitigation**: Use DOMPurify or similar library to sanitize HTML content before injection.\n\n### 2. Hardcoded Secrets Exposure - MEDIUM SEVERITY\n\n#### Exposed API Keys in Source Code\n```javascript\n// supabaseClient.js - EXPOSED CREDENTIALS\nconst supabaseUrl = \"https://pkdvzchmpzkapwzlicpr.supabase.co\";\nconst supabaseAnonKey = \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InBrZHZ6Y2htcHprYXB3emxpY3ByIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDU2Mjk3ODcsImV4cCI6MjA2MTIwNTc4N30.wE4J0SutgzRqHehwo3a6oZFaLzDNCBVNFMO5ObkguLE\";\n\n// Test.jsx - EXPOSED PRODUCTION URL\nconst supabaseUrl = \"https://pkdvzchmpzkapwzlicpr.supabase.co\";\n```\n\n**Risk**: Hardcoded credentials in source code are visible to anyone with repository access.\n**Impact**: Unauthorized access to database, potential data breaches.\n**Mitigation**: Move all credentials to environment variables, remove fallback values.\n\n### 3. Insecure External Resource Loading - MEDIUM SEVERITY\n\n#### Unvalidated External Image Sources\n```jsx\n// Multiple files loading images from external domains without validation:\nsrc=\"https://via.placeholder.com/150\"                    // ProfileForm.jsx\nsrc=\"https://www.svgrepo.com/show/475656/google-color.svg\"  // Login.jsx\nsrc=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-*\"                // Invoices.jsx (multiple)\n```\n\n**Risk**: External resources could be compromised or used for tracking.\n**Impact**: Content injection, user tracking, dependency on external services.\n**Mitigation**: Host images locally or validate external sources.\n\n## 🛡️ AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION ISSUES\n\n### 4. Insufficient Input Validation - MEDIUM SEVERITY\n\n#### Weak Email Validation\n```javascript\n// Multiple files using same permissive regex\nconst emailRegex = /^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$/;\n```\n\n**Risk**: Overly permissive regex allows malformed emails.\n**Impact**: Data quality issues, potential bypass of email-based security measures.\n**Mitigation**: Use more strict email validation library.\n\n#### Weak Password Validation\n```javascript\n// authService.js - Minimal password requirements\nif (password.length < 8) {\n  result.errors.push('Password deve essere di almeno 8 caratteri.');\n}\n// Missing: special characters, complexity requirements\n```\n\n**Risk**: Weak passwords increase brute force attack success.\n**Impact**: Account compromise through password attacks.\n**Mitigation**: Implement stronger password requirements.\n\n### 5. Session Management Issues - MEDIUM SEVERITY\n\n#### No Session Timeout Implementation\n```javascript\n// AuthContext.jsx - Sessions persist indefinitely\nauth: {\n  persistSession: true,\n  autoRefreshToken: true,\n  // ❌ No session timeout configured\n}\n```\n\n**Risk**: Abandoned sessions remain active indefinitely.\n**Impact**: Unauthorized access from unattended devices.\n**Mitigation**: Implement session timeout and idle detection.\n\n#### Insufficient Session Validation\n```javascript\n// Multiple files checking user existence but not session validity\nif (!user) {\n  alert('Devi essere autenticato per salvare un cliente');\n  return; // ❌ Should redirect to login, not just alert\n}\n```\n\n**Risk**: Expired sessions not properly handled.\n**Impact**: Users may operate with invalid sessions.\n**Mitigation**: Implement proper session validation and redirect logic.\n\n## 🔍 DATA PROTECTION & PRIVACY ISSUES\n\n### 6. Insufficient Data Access Controls - HIGH SEVERITY\n\n#### Client-Side Authorization Only\n```javascript\n// All database queries rely on client-side user_id filtering\n.eq('user_id', user.id)  // ❌ Client-controlled, can be manipulated\n```\n\n**Risk**: Malicious users could modify client-side code to access other users' data.\n**Impact**: Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n**Mitigation**: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) on database side.\n\n#### No Data Sanitization Before Database Storage\n```javascript\n// clientService.js - Direct data insertion without sanitization\nconst dbData = this.prepareClientDataForDB(clientData, user.id);\n// ❌ No input sanitization or validation\n```\n\n**Risk**: Malicious data could be stored and later executed.\n**Impact**: Stored XSS, data corruption.\n**Mitigation**: Sanitize all user input before database storage.\n\n### 7. Logging Security Issues - MEDIUM SEVERITY\n\n#### Sensitive Data in Console Logs\n```javascript\n// Multiple files logging sensitive information\nconsole.log('Dati client da salvare:', clientData);  // ❌ PII in logs\nconsole.log('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:', supabaseAnonKey);  // ❌ Credentials in logs\n```\n\n**Risk**: Sensitive data exposed in browser console and server logs.\n**Impact**: Data leakage, credential exposure.\n**Mitigation**: Remove sensitive data from logs, implement proper logging levels.\n\n## 🚨 ADDITIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS\n\n### 8. CORS & CSP Issues - MEDIUM SEVERITY\n\n#### No Content Security Policy\n- No CSP headers configured\n- External resources loaded without restrictions\n- Inline scripts and styles allowed\n\n**Risk**: XSS attacks easier to execute.\n**Impact**: Script injection, data theft.\n**Mitigation**: Implement strict CSP headers.\n\n### 9. Error Information Disclosure - LOW SEVERITY\n\n#### Detailed Error Messages\n```javascript\n// Multiple files exposing internal error details\nalert(`Errore durante l'eliminazione: ${error.message}`);\nconsole.error('Error fetching clients:', error);\n```\n\n**Risk**: Internal system information leaked to users.\n**Impact**: Information disclosure for attackers.\n**Mitigation**: Use generic error messages for users, log details server-side.\n\n## 📋 SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY\n\n### IMMEDIATE (Critical)\n1. **Sanitize HTML injection** - Fix dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage\n2. **Remove hardcoded credentials** - Move to environment variables  \n3. **Implement Row Level Security** - Add database-level access controls\n4. **Add input sanitization** - Sanitize all user inputs before storage\n\n### HIGH PRIORITY\n1. **Implement session timeout** - Add idle detection and forced logout\n2. **Strengthen password requirements** - Add complexity requirements\n3. **Add proper error handling** -

        "description": "Resolve the critical XSS vulnerability in QuoteEmailSender.jsx by sanitizing all user-generated HTML before rendering with dangerouslySetInnerHTML, using DOMPurify.",
        "details": "1. Install DOMPurify as a project dependency using npm or yarn (e.g., `npm install dompurify`).\n2. In QuoteEmailSender.jsx, import DOMPurify (`import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';`).\n3. Identify all instances where dangerouslySetInnerHTML is used to render user-provided or dynamic HTML content.\n4. Refactor the code so that, before passing any HTML to dangerouslySetInnerHTML, it is sanitized using `DOMPurify.sanitize(htmlString)`. For example:\n\n```jsx\nconst sanitizedHtml = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInputHtml);\n<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedHtml }} />\n```\n5. Ensure that the sanitization step is applied to all relevant HTML sources, not just the primary user input.\n6. Review DOMPurify configuration options to ensure only safe HTML is allowed (e.g., `{ USE_PROFILES: { html: true } }`).\n7. Document the change in the codebase and add comments explaining the security rationale.\n8. Update or add unit and integration tests to verify that malicious scripts are not executed and that legitimate HTML is rendered correctly.\n9. Coordinate with QA/security to perform a targeted security retest of the component.\n<info added on 2025-06-20T20:13:12.247Z>\n## Task Completion Report\n\nXSS Vulnerability in QuoteEmailSender.jsx has been fully mitigated:\n\n### Security Implementation Completed:\n1. DOMPurify dependency already installed (v3.2.6)\n2. Sanitization function properly implemented with secure configuration\n3. All dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage properly protected\n4. Security configuration hardened:\n   - Removed style attributes to prevent CSS-based XSS\n   - Added URI regex validation for links\n   - Explicit FORBID_ATTR and FORBID_TAGS for dangerous elements\n   - Added SANITIZE_DOM and KEEP_CONTENT flags\n\n### Comprehensive Testing Completed:\n1. Created full test suite (QuoteEmailSender.test.jsx)\n2. Created XSS security demonstration utility (xss-security-demo.js)\n3. Created security test runner (test-xss-security.js)\n4. All 6 XSS attack vectors blocked:\n   - Script tag injection: BLOCKED\n   - Event handler injection: BLOCKED  \n   - JavaScript URL injection: BLOCKED\n   - Data attribute injection: BLOCKED\n   - Iframe injection: BLOCKED\n   - Style-based XSS injection: BLOCKED\n5. Legitimate HTML formatting preserved (bold, italic, lists, links)\n\n### Security Status: FULLY PROTECTED\nAll malicious scripts are sanitized while preserving legitimate HTML formatting. The component is now secure against XSS attacks.\n</info added on 2025-06-20T20:13:12.247Z>",
        "testStrategy": "1. Write unit tests that attempt to inject malicious scripts (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>) and verify they are removed from the rendered output.\n2. Manually test the QuoteEmailSender component by sending emails with various HTML payloads, confirming that only safe content is rendered and no XSS is possible.\n3. Use automated security scanning tools (e.g., SonarQube, npm audit) to confirm the vulnerability is resolved.\n4. Verify that legitimate HTML formatting (bold, italics, links) is preserved after sanitization.\n5. Review browser console for errors or warnings related to DOMPurify or rendering.\n6. Confirm that the component's functionality (sending and displaying quotes via email) is unaffected by the change.",

For each relevant table, enable RLS using SQL (e.g., `ALTER TABLE <table> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`).\n3. Define and implement granular RLS policies that restrict access to rows based on the authenticated user's identity, typically by matching `auth.uid()` to the `user_id` column (e.g., `CREATE POLICY \"Users can access their own data\" ON <table> FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());`).\n4. Remove or refactor any client-side filtering logic that previously relied on user_id, ensuring all authorization is enforced server-side.\n5. Validate that all Supabase API endpoints and direct queries respect the new RLS policies, and update documentation for developers regarding the new security model.\n6.
